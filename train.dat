en | The 2009 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season was the 61st F.I.M. Road Racing World Championship
en | season. The season consisted out of 17 races for the MotoGP class and 16 for
en | the 125cc and 250cc classes, beginning with the Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix on 12 April
en | 2009 and ending with the Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix on 8 November. Preseason Cost-cutting
en | measures As announced during 2008, MotoGP class switched to a single-tyre manufacturer ending a previous
en | Tyre war between Dunlop, Bridgestone, and Michelin that started in the 2002 season (though Dunlop
en | left as a tyre manufacturer in 2007). The move was made to try to improve
en | safety by reducing cornering speeds, and in a marginal way for cost reasons; the winner
en | was decided by bid. Michelin, one of the two tyre suppliers in 2008, decided not
en | to bid for the supply, effectively declaring Bridgestone the winner, which was confirmed on 18
en | October 2008. Bridgestone will be the sole tyre supplier from 2009 to 2011. Only race
en | spec tyres will be provided to the teams, eliminating qualifying tyres, in use until 2008.
en | Other cost-cutting manoeuvers were made during the winter prior to the season, to try to
en | contain the rising costs of the sport, especially during the 2008 financial crisis. FIM was
en | especially concerned, fearing that defections among private and factory teams could leave the grid with
en | 14 bikes only. After negotiations between FIM, Dorna and MSMA (the manufacturers' association), new measures
en | were adopted. The Friday morning free practice session was eliminated, limiting the Friday practice time
en | to a single 45-minute session (later brought to a 1-hour session from the French GP
en | onwards); a limit of 5 engines was imposed for the last 7 races, with a
en | 10-point penalty for each additional engine used; ceramic composite materials for brakes were banned; electronic
en | assistance was reduced with the ban of electronic controlled suspensions and launch control systems; Monday
en | tests will be cancelled except for Catalunya and Brno, where only test riders will be
en | allowed to take part. Kawasaki withdrawal and return With a somewhat unexpected announcement, Kawasaki made
en | public its intention to withdraw from MotoGP immediately on 9 January 2009, citing the global
en | economic downturn as the main cause of the decision. Initial negotiations between Dorna and Kawasaki
en | aimed to run the two bikes with the private Aspar team, but after further talks,
en | on 26 February 2009 Kawasaki announced its decision to remain in the category, running a
en | single bike team with Marco Melandri, effectively leaving John Hopkins without a contract. The team
en | ran under the Hayate Racing banner, as announced on 1 March 2009. Season review MotoGP
en | Valentino Rossi won his sixth MotoGP title, seventh in the top class and ninth title
en | in total after getting the better of teammate Jorge Lorenzo in a season-long battle. The
en | season was marked by the dominance of Yamaha duo Rossi and Lorenzo, with occasional wins
en | for Dani Pedrosa and Casey Stoner. Riding the factory Ducati, 2007 champion Stoner won the
en | opener in Qatar as well as a rain-hit race in Italy to open up a
en | championship lead after six rounds. Inconsistent handling from the Ducati as well as health problems
en | for Stoner causing fatigue saw him drop out of the title fight by mid-season, whereas
en | Pedrosa and Lorenzo crashed more often than Rossi who built up a sizeable lead to
en | win the title. 250cc class In the final 250cc championship (it was replaced by the
en | Moto2 class in 2010), Hiroshi Aoyama became the third Japanese rider to win that title,
en | after Tetsuya Harada and Daijiro Kato. 125cc class In the 125cc class, Julián Simón won
en | the title after taking seven victories during the season. 2009 Grand Prix season calendar The
en | following Grands Prix were scheduled to take place in 2009: The 2009 revised race schedule
en | was released on 24 October 2008. A Hungarian round was originally scheduled for 20 September
en | 2009 but the organizers asked Dorna to postpone the event to 2010 due to delays
en | in the construction of the Balatonring circuit. Due to adverse weather conditions, the Qatar MotoGP
en | race was postponed until 13 April. ‡ = Night race, MotoGP race held on Monday
en | because of rainfall on Sunday. † = MotoGP class only †† = Saturday race Calendar
en | changes The Japanese Grand Prix was moved forward, from 28 September to 26 April. The
en | Portuguese Grand Prix was moved back, from 13 April to 4 October. The Chinese Grand
en | Prix was taken off the calendar due to a dire spectator attendance, poor promotion and
en | an overall lack of commercial interest in the venue. The British Grand Prix was moved
en | back, from 22 June to 26 July. Only the MotoGP class raced during the United
en | States Grand Prix because of a Californian law on air pollution, preventing the 125 and
en | 250cc classes from racing. Regulation changes The following changes are made to the regulation for
en | the 2009 season: Sporting regulations A big overhaul has been made to the standard time
en | schedule for all days. The Friday morning Free Practice session will be cancelled for all
en | three classes and the three MotoGP Practice Sessions, as well as Saturday Qualifying, will be
en | shortened from one hour to 45 minutes. Warm-Up times and Race distances are not altered.
en | For the Free Practice one sessions on Friday, the times are now as follows: FP1
en | from 13:05 to 13:45 for the 125cc class. FP1 from 14:05 to 14:50 for the
en | MotoGP class. FP1 from 15:05 to 15:50 for the 250cc class. For the Free Practice
en | two and Qualifying Practice sessions on Saturday, the times are now as follows: FP2 from
en | 09:05 to 09:45 for the 125cc class. FP2 from 10:05 to 10:50 for the MotoGP
en | class. FP2 from 11:05 to 11:50 for the 250cc class. QP from 13:05 to 13:45
en | for the 125cc class. QP from 14:05 to 14:50 for the MotoGP class. QP from
en | 15:05 to 15:50 for the 250cc class. For the Warm-Up and Race sessions on Sunday,
en | the times are now as follows: WUP from 08:40 to 09:00 for the 125cc class.
en | WUP from 09:10 to 09:30 for the MotoGP class. WUP from 09:40 to 10:00 for
en | the 250cc class. Race from 11:00 to 12:00 for the 125cc class. Race from 12:15
en | to 13:15 for the 250cc class. Race from 14:00 to 15:00 for the MotoGP class.
en | Only two post-race tests are now allowed. The circuits chosen are the Catalan and Czech
en | ones and the tests are only allowed if they are for development purposes and if
en | test riders are used. These rules were additionally added on the 25th of July 2009:
en | The rules for practice restrictions have been updated. For the purpose of practice restrictions, the
en | year is split into two parts: the season itself and the winter. The season is
en | defined as 'the period starting fourteen days before the first race of the year and
en | ending two days after the last race of the year, both dates being inclusive'. The
en | winter is defined as 'the rest of the year, starting four days after the last
en | race of the season and ending fifteen days before the first race of the next
en | season, both dates being inclusive.' Using riders under contract to practice with MotoGP bikes is
en | not allowed during the season as well as the breaks at any track included on
en | the current year's calendar. The following exceptions to this rule apply if: The practice is
en | added to the event schedule. The practice happens during the day(s) immediately after the race
en | at three circuits, at the circuit where the race has occurred. The final race of
en | the season will always be held at one of the three circuits and will be
en | the only two-day test which is allowed. The others will only consist out of one
en | test day. The other two circuits must be nominated by the Grand Prix Commission by
en | 31 January of that year. The activity has been specifically approved by the Race Direction.
en | The same goes for the winter period. It is forbidden to use contracted riders to
en | practice with MotoGP at any circuit. The following exceptions apply to this rule if: There's
en | a maximum of six days where Dorna/IRTA organise official tests at tracks which were added
en | to the calendars of the previous or next year. No testing is allowed during the
en | period between 1 December of one year and 31 January of the next year, both
en | dates being inclusive. The winter test schedule must be approved the Grand Prix Commission. The
en | activity has been specifically approved by the Race Direction. Rules for the practice by non-contracted
en | riders have been changed. The practice by non-contracted or test riders is permitted at any
en | circuit at all times, but is limited specifically by the use of a maximum of
en | 240 tyres per manufacturer, per calendar year, which is solely supplied by the MotoGP tyre
en | supplier. There is an exception to this rule however and it is forbidden to test
en | during the season and the breaks at a circuit included on the calendar before the
en | race there has happened. Nonetheless, manufacturers can designate and inform the Race Direction of the
en | two circuits where they can test before 31 January of each year, but not within
en | fourteen days of the scheduled event at the circuits. Said schedule of these tests and
en | any following amendments must have to be told to the Race Direction at least seven
en | days ahead of time. The definition of a 'contracted rider' and a 'rookie rider' have
en | been clarified. A contracted rider is a rider who has ridden in nine or more
en | events during a single season. A rookie is a rider who is submitted by a
en | participating team for participation in the full season but is not a contracted rider as
en | is defined in the same class in any past season. For the purpose of this
en | section, the old 500cc and MotoGP class are considered to be the same as well
en | as the current 250cc, which will be renamed to the Moto2 class in 2010. This
en | rule was additionally added on the 24th of August 2009: All the MotoGP Practice and
en | Qualifying sessions are going to be extended again, from 45 minutes to one hour as
en | of the French Grand Prix onwards. Technical regulations In September 2008, it was decided that
en | from 2009 onwards there will only be a single tyre manufacturer for the MotoGP class.
en | Proposals could be sent in to the FIM and Dorna until 3 October 2008 after
en | which the eventual winner were to be announced by the Grand Prix Commission on 18
en | October 2008. Bridgestone sent in a bid whilst supplying rival Michelin, did not. The eventual
en | proposal was studied and on 18 October, it was announced that Bridgestone were to become
en | the sole tyre supplier for a three-year period. From the Czech Republic GP onwards, a
en | maximum of five engines will only be allowed for use in the final eight races
en | of the season. Changing parts is not allowed, with the exception of daily maintenance. Composite
en | materials made out of ceramic is now forbidden to use on the brake discs or
en | pads. A launch control system is now prohibited. A suspension which is controlled by electronics
en | is now prohibited as well. These rules were additionally added on the 25th of July
en | 2009: Rules on the engine durability have been greatly extended. In the MotoGP class, the
en | number of available engines to use for all riders is limited. For 2009, a maximum
en | of five engines for the final seven scheduled races of the season starting from the
en | 2009 Czech Grand Prix until the end of the season. If a rider is replaced
en | for any given reason, the replacement rider will be considered as the original rider so
en | that the engine can be granted. The available engines for the exclusive use of each
en | rider has to marked and sealed by the Technical Director before it can be used.
en | The team has the responsibility to register any new engine with the Technical Directed before
en | it can be used. Once it is registered and used for the first time, the
en | engines can not be swapped between riders even if they are from the same team.
en | A new engine is considered to be used when the bike with said engine crosses
en | the transponder timing point at the pitlane exit. The engines will be sealed via wiring
en | and identification tabs so that: The timing system is not within each. For example, the
en | head cover has to be wired to the cylinder head. The timing driving system is
en | not within each. For example, the geartrain/chain cover is wired so that it can't be
en | taken off. The cylinder head as well as the cylinder block (if there are any)
en | can't be removed from the engine. For example, the cylinder head is wired to the
en | cylinder block and the cylinder block is wired to the engine crankcase. - The crankcase
en | can't be opened. For example, the crankcase halves are wired together. Teams are allowed to
en | replace all the parts which can be accessed without having to remove the sealing wiring.
en | If the sealing wiring is broken or removed without direction by the Technical Direction, the
en | engine will be considered "rebuilt" and engines with broken or missing security seals will be
en | treated as a wholly new engine in the allocation. If a competitor, for any reason
en | (mechanical failure, crash, major damage and so on) has to use another engine above their
en | allocation, the Technical Director has to be informed before said engine can be used so
en | that the Race Direction can apply the proper penalty. The damaged engine will be removed
en | from the allocation and, if it is to be used again, will be treated as
en | a new engine with the fitting penalty applied. There is no limit to the number
en | of times a sealed, allocated engine can be fitted to and used in a bike,
en | on the condition that the security seal is not broken or removed. Replacing an engine
en | with another sealed engine, be it new or used, from the rider's allocation is allowed
en | and no penalty shall be given if done. To prevent the running of a used,
en | allocated engine outside of any MotoGP races, all the allocated engines will have security seals
en | placed over either the exhaust or inlet ports (on at least one cylinder bank if
en | the engine is a V-type) before it can leave the circuit. If a team wants
en | to re-use such an allocated and sealed engine, it must first request to the Technical
en | Director to remove all security seals. If the Technical Director or his staff discover that
en | the security seals are not intact, the engine will be branded as a new engine
en | in the allocation and a penalty will be handed out. Any Exhaust Gas Recirculation (also
en | known as EGR) systems are now prohibited. It is forbidden to use any hydraulic and/or
en | pneumatic pressurised powered systems, the exception being cylinder inlet/exhaust valve springs. All hydraulic systems on
en | the bike have to be powered only by the manual inputs of the rider. Normal
en | hydraulic hand and foot controls such as master/slave cylinders for the brakes and clutch are
en | allowed, as are pneumatic engine valve actuating systems and oil and water pumps for entine
en | lubricating and cooling. Using engine lubricating oil for any motive other than lubrication and cooling
en | (such as powered hydraulic systems) is forbidden. All bikes must have a minimum of one
en | brake on each wheel which operates in an independent way. In the 125cc and 250cc
en | classes, brake discs which consist out of ferrous materials only are permitted. In all classes,
en | materials made out of ceramic composite are not allowed for the brake discs or the
en | brake pads. Ceramic materials are defined as 'inorganic, non metallic solids (for example: Al2O3, SiC,
en | B4C, Ti5Si3, SiO2 and Si3N4)'. Electric and electronic controlled suspension and steering damper systems are
en | forbidden. Changes to the suspension and steering damper systems can only be made via manual
en | inputs and mechanical/hydraulic changes. Racing numbers have to be attached to the front as well
en | as both sides of the bike. For the MotoGP class, only the front number is
en | required. Numbers should have a height of at least 140 mm. Numbers have to be
en | clearly readable and strongly differ from the background colour. Backgrounds have to be of a
en | single colour over a large enough area to provide a minimum clear area of 25
en | mm around the number. In the case of a dispute over the readability of numbers,
en | the decision taken by the Technical Direction will be concluding. 2009 Grand Prix season results

en | zswap is a Linux kernel feature that provides a compressed write-back cache for swapped pages,
en | as a form of virtual memory compression. Instead of moving memory pages to a swap
en | device when they are to be swapped out, zswap performs their compression and then stores
en | them into a memory pool dynamically allocated in the system RAM. Later writeback to the
en | actual swap device is deferred or even completely avoided, resulting in a significantly reduced I/O
en | for Linux systems that require swapping; the tradeoff is the need for additional CPU cycles
en | to perform the compression. As a result of reduced I/O, zswap offers advantages to various
en | devices that use flash-based storage, including embedded devices, netbooks and similar low-end hardware devices, as
en | well as to other devices that use solid-state drives (SSDs) for storage. Flash memory has
en | a limited lifespan due to its nature, so avoiding it to be used for providing
en | swap space prevents it from wearing out quickly. Internals zswap is integrated into the rest
en | of Linux kernel's virtual memory subsystem using the API provided by frontswap, which is a
en | mechanism of the Linux kernel that abstracts various types of storage that can be used
en | as swap space. As a result, zswap operates as a backend driver for frontswap by
en | providing what is internally visible as a pseudo-RAM device. In other words, the frontswap API
en | makes zswap capable of intercepting memory pages while they are being swapped out, and capable
en | of intercepting page faults for the already swapped pages; the access to those two paths
en | allows zswap to act as a compressed write-back cache for swapped pages. Internally, zswap uses
en | compression modules provided by the Linux kernel's crypto API, which makes it possible, for example,
en | to offload the compression tasks from the main CPU using any of the hardware compression
en | accelerators supported by the Linux kernel. The selection of the desired compression module can be
en | performed dynamically at the boot time through the value of kernel boot parameter zswap.compressor; if
en | not specified, it selects the Lempel–Ziv–Oberhumer (LZO) compression. As of version 3.13 of the Linux
en | kernel, zswap also needs to be explicitly enabled by specifying value 1 for the kernel
en | boot parameter zswap.enabled. The maximum size of the memory pool used by zswap is configurable
en | through the sysfs parameter max_pool_percent, which specifies the maximum percentage of total system RAM that
en | can be occupied by the pool. The memory pool is not preallocated to its configured
en | maximum size, and instead grows and shrinks as required. When the configured maximum pool size
en | is reached as the result of performed swapping, or when growing the pool is impossible
en | due to an out-of-memory condition, swapped pages are evicted from the memory pool to a
en | swap device on the least recently used (LRU) basis. This approach makes zswap a true
en | swap cache, as the oldest cached pages are evicted to a swap device once the
en | cache is full, making room for newer swapped pages to be compressed and cached. zbud
en | is a special-purpose memory allocator used internally by zswap for storing compressed pages, implemented as
en | a rewrite of the zbud allocator used by the Oracle's zcache, which is another virtual
en | memory compression implementation for the Linux kernel. Internally, zbud works by storing up to two
en | compressed pages ("buddies", hence the allocator name) per physical memory page, which brings both advantages
en | due to easy coalescing and reusing of freed space, and disadvantages due to possible lower
en | memory utilization. However, as a result of its design, zbud cannot allocate more memory space
en | than it would be originally occupied by the uncompressed pages. History Both zswap and zbud
en | were created by Seth Jennings. The first public announcement was in December 2012, and the
en | development continued until May 2013 at which point the codebase reached its maturity although still
en | having the status of an experimental kernel feature. zswap (together with zbud) was merged into
en | the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 3.11, which was released on September 2, 2013.
en | Since version 3.15 of the Linux kernel, which was released on June 8, 2014, zswap
en | properly supports multiple swap devices. Since version 6.8 of the Linux kernel, which was released
en | on March 11, 2024, zswap supports disabling writeback for specific cgroups. Alternatives One of the
en | alternatives to zswap is zram, which provides a similar but still different "swap compressed pages
en | to RAM" mechanism to the Linux kernel. The main difference is that zram provides a
en | compressed block device using RAM for storing data, which acts as a regular and separate
en | swap device. In comparison, zswap acts as a RAM-based cache for swap devices. This provides
en | zswap with an eviction mechanism for less used swapped pages, which zram lacked until the
en | introduction of CONFIG_ZRAM_WRITEBACK in kernel version 4.14. Though, as a result of its design, at
en | least one already existing swap device is required for zswap to be used. See also

en | in Čačak, Principality of Serbia. He finished his gymnasium in Belgrade before the Metropolitan of
en | Belgrade Mihailo sent him to Imperial Russia for higher education, and to specialize in iconography.
en | He was first sent to Sergiyev Posad to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius (1870),
en | Kiev Pechersk Lavra (1871 to 1873), Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (1873) and
en | later the Department of Education in Serbia made it possible for him to study in
en | Italy at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia (1877-= to 1878), Accademia di Belle
en | Arti di Firenze (1879) and the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich (1880). He then

en | The LeRoy Smith House is a private house, designed by Alden B. Dow, and located
en | at 9503 Frank Street in Algonac, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of
en | Historic Places in 1996. History LeRoy Smith was a salesman for the Hobart Company, which
en | manufactured paint sprayers, battery chargers, and welding equipment. After working for Hobart for a time,
en | Smith founded his own company to distribute Hobart equipment. Smith and his family lived in
en | Highland Park, Michigan, but owned this plot of land along the St. Clair River near
en | Algonac for summer trips. In the late 1930s, the Smiths decided to build a summer
en | house on the property to take advantage of the river view. Their daughter Maxine's parents-in-law
en | had commissioned a house from Alden B. Dow in 1938, and although they had ultimately
en | decided not to build, they highly recommended Dow to the Smiths. The Smiths contacted Dow
en | in 1940, and construction began on this house in December of that year. However, the
en | contractor had difficulties, and the house was not finished until early 1942. Description The LeRoy
en | Smith House is a two-story, flat-roofed house constructed of 12 in × 12 in (300
en | mm × 300 mm) cinder "unit blocks" designed and patented by Dow. A long, low
en | three-car garage extends at a right angle from the corner of the house. The street
en | side of the house has a plain, flat facade with a few small windows; the
en | river side, in contrast, contains a large expanse of windows opening onto the water, underneath
